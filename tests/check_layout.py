check_layout.py — catch the layout faults that make a *correct* worksheet
unusable in front of a student.

Usage: python3 tests/check_layout.py <worksheet.tex> [--figs <figs.tex>]

Each fault below was found by generating a real sheet: every answer verified,
every figure label correct, and the printed page still misleading or unusable.
None is visible to verify.py, which only sees the JSON.

1. FIGURE SCOPE. A figure carrying numbers belongs to exactly one problem, but
   on the page it simply sits near several. If problem 6 has a triangle labelled
   a=6, b=8 and problems 7-8 have none, a student reading 7 sees a labelled
   triangle a few lines up and reasonably assumes it applies. The figure is
   correct and the worksheet is still wrong. Rule: within one problem list, no
   problem may be left with NO figure while another's figure carries values.
   Shared conventions belong in a value-free reference figure outside the list.

   What matters is the figureless problem, not the value-free one. A problem
   holding its own blank grid — "plot your counterexample here", "draw the line
   through these points" — is not at risk: the picture inside its block is
   visibly the one it means, and a grid's own axis numbers are scale, not
   another problem's data. Counting valued-against-total instead failed a sheet
   where all ten problems had a graph and three were empty axes to plot on, and
   the only edit that would have satisfied it was deleting those three grids.

2. WORK SPACE. SKILL.md specifies ~5cm per problem, 8cm multi-step. Nothing
   enforced it, so a generator can emit itemsep=14pt (about half a line) and
   produce a sheet with nowhere to show work. Trig and multi-step algebra need
   three or four lines each. Space is credited from itemsep, signed \vspace
   (deliberate reclaiming with \vspace{-2.9cm} is charged, not ignored),
   \\[5cm] line skips, and the three standard skips — all of which put real
   ink-to-ink distance on the page.

3. PAGE-BREAK GLUE. LaTeX discards \vspace glue that falls at a page or column
   break, so workspace left outside a minipage silently vanishes exactly when
   its problem lands at a page bottom — a multi-page sheet loses the workspace
   of roughly one problem per page. The fix is structural: keep the workspace
   inside the problem's unbreakable minipage (\par\vspace*{5cm} before
   \end{minipage}, see references/latex-templates.md). A workspace-sized
   unstarred \vspace outside any minipage is therefore a fault. Starred
   \vspace* at least survives the break, so it is tolerated as a minimal fix.

4. ANSWER LOCATION. Bare workspace gives the grader nowhere to look and the
   student nothing to commit to — the final answer drowns in scratch work.
   Every enumerate \item must therefore contain one answer-location macro:
   \ansline (right-aligned blank), \ansblank (inline drill blank),
   \answerline{unit} (blank + measurement unit), or \noansline (explicit
   opt-out for problems whose worked product IS the answer — sketch, proof,
   construction). \problem regions are exempt BY DESIGN: the shipped
   preamble's \problem macro emits the answer line itself whenever its
   workspace argument is positive, so the document body shows nothing to
   count — construction, not linting, is the guarantee there. Rules run on
   comment-stripped text, so a commented-out marker can never satisfy this.

Both the enumerate/\item and the \problem{...} macro shapes are parsed — the
skill's first-taught template style is \problem, and a checker that only sees
enumerate lists passes a zero-workspace \problem sheet vacuously (the same
zero-parse failure class fixed in check_prose_consistency.py). Enumerate
parsing is DEPTH-AWARE via _tex_segments.enumerate_lists: every nested
part-list is checked as its own list against its own [itemsep=..], and a
naive regex that truncated the outer list at the first nested \end{enumerate}
(dropping every item after the multi-part problem) is gone.

Exit 0 clean, 1 on any fault, 2 when nothing parsed (no list and no \problem
block means nothing was checked — that is NOT a pass). Skips answer keys and
study guides, which are read rather than written on.
