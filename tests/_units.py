r"""_units.py — shared unit lexicon + LaTeX token matching for the unit gates.

One module used by BOTH unit checkers (check_answer_key.py's key-side gate and
check_answer_line.py's sheet-side gate), for the same reason _tex_segments.py
exists: two hand-rolled matchers would drift apart and disagree about what
counts as a printed unit.

Matching is token-SEQUENCE containment, never substring: "undefined" is one
token and can never satisfy "in" the inch, and \text{ or } contains no lexicon
token at all — so the connective in \boxed{x = 2 \text{ or } x = 3} is clean
by construction, not by special-casing.

The lexicon is CLOSED on purpose. Flagging every \text{} would false-fail
legitimate prose inside boxes; a unit gate should only fire on something that
is unambiguously a unit.

Documented limitation: PREFIX currency symbols ($5, \$) are out of scope —
the dollar sign doubles as the math delimiter and cannot be token-matched
safely. Write "in dollars" in the problem stem instead of declaring a
currency answer_unit.
