page_budget.py — derive a worksheet's page budget from what it actually asks
of the student, instead of a flat cap.

Usage: python3 scripts/page_budget.py <verify.json> [--doc ws|ak]
                [--paper letter|a4|legal] [--max-pages]
                [--from-tex ws.tex | --type-size 17pt --accessible large]

WHY THIS EXISTS
A single number ("worksheets may not exceed 8 pages") is wrong in both
directions at once. Fifty linear-graphing problems each need their own
coordinate plane and legitimately run past twenty pages; a flat cap fails that
sheet, and the only way to pass is to shrink the planes or drop the workspace,
which is exactly the compression this system exists to prevent. Meanwhile ten
arithmetic drills that somehow filled eight pages sail through the same cap
while wasting seven sheets of a school's paper budget.

So the budget is COMPUTED from the problem set: how many problems, and how much
room each kind of problem deserves. The gate then asks the only question worth
asking — did this sheet land where its own content says it should? — and it is
two-sided:

  too many pages  -> bloat: paper spent on layout accident, not on work space
  too few pages   -> compression: the work space was squeezed to fit

Space is never the thing that gives. If a sheet needs more pages, it gets them;
the budget moves. What the gate refuses is a page count that does not match the
work the sheet contains.

COST MODEL (cm of column height, worksheet geometry: 24.1cm usable per page)
Each problem costs a fixed overhead plus the workspace its kind deserves. The
workspace figures are SKILL.md's own guidance (~5cm standard, 8cm multi-step,
10cm+ for graphs), and the overheads are measured from the shipped preamble.

Per problem:
  0.4cm  \problem lead-in
  0.6cm  stem (1.2cm when the stem is a word problem: longer prose wraps)
  0.3cm  answer line
  + workspace by class (below)
  + 5.0cm when the problem carries a figure (a coordinate plane or geometric
    figure is ~9cm tall and partly overlaps the workspace the student would
    otherwise use)

Two-column drill sheets pack two problems per row, so a sheet whose problems are
ALL compact is charged half the per-problem height. Compact means the room a
problem ACTUALLY gets — what its author declared, or the type default when
nobody declared anything — not what its type would have got by default.

A problem's several verifier entries are one BLOCK on the page, so the budget
merges them: the block is charged the tallest workspace any of its entries
claims, carries a figure if any entry does, and is a word problem if any entry
says so. Reading those facts off the first entry alone is what made the budget
under-measure and then fail correct sheets at compile.

Exit 0 always when the JSON parses (this computes a budget, it does not judge a
document). --max-pages prints just the ceiling, for build.sh to pass to
compile.sh. Exit 2 on unreadable/oversized input.

# ── Type size ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every cm above is measured at 12pt. SKILL.md offers large-print and
# dyslexia-friendly output and promised "the page budget adapts automatically;
# larger type simply means more pages" — and it did not adapt at all: nothing
# here knew the document's point size, so a large-print sheet was sized against
# 12pt constants. Measured, not estimated: a prose-heavy 10-problem sheet is 4
# pages at 12pt against a ceiling of 4, and 5 pages at 17pt. The gate failed a
# correct accessible worksheet, and the only edits that would have satisfied it
# were cutting problems or shortening stems — the compression this module exists
# to refuse.
#
# The factors are the typeset height of one identical paragraph in each of the
# twelve documented configurations, divided by its height at 12pt. They are
# measured because they are not derivable: \accessiblemode raises leading on top
# of the point size, so 14pt large-print text is 1.69x tall, not the 1.17x its
# point size suggests. Reproduce with tests/test_page_budget_type_size.py.

# in centimetres and \problem lays down as literal vertical space, and a figure
# is drawn at a fixed size — neither moves when the type does.

    The page does not care: \\problem lays down one block per id. So the facts
    that describe that block have to be gathered from ALL of the id's entries,
    not read off whichever one happens to be first.

    Keeping only the first entry is what this used to do, and it lost every
    workspace_cm an author wrote on a later one — while unpriced_pictures, forty
    lines up in this same file, merged across entries and therefore stayed
    quiet. The budget under-measured, the ceiling came out short, and the
    compile then failed the sheet asking the author to declare a field they had
    already declared. Reproduced in a run: the same numbers moved from the last
    entry of each id to the first took a sheet from 65cm to 129cm, ideal 3 to
    ideal 6, against a real 7 pages.

    WHERE ENTRIES DISAGREE THE BLOCK GETS THE TALLEST CLAIM. Each entry claims
    the room it needs — what it declared, or its type's default when it declared
    nothing — and the block has to hold all of them, so the block is as tall as
    the tallest. A problem that computes a value AND asks for the reasoning is
    two entries, `eval` and `manual`, and the writing part still needs its prose
    room whether or not the arithmetic part put a number on itself.

    That matters because a default is a CLAIM, not a blank. Taking only the
    declared numbers would let a 5.5cm written on the `eval` half quietly shrink
    the 8cm the `manual` half was asking for, and an author who declared one
    number for one check would have silently resized a part they never touched.

    counting defaults as claims puts 50 more sheets closer to their real length
