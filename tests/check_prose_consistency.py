check_prose_consistency.py — flag numbers in worksheet prose that don't appear
as givens in the verify JSON (the word-problem analog of the figure rule).

Usage: python3 tests/check_prose_consistency.py <worksheet.tex> <verify.json>
                [--figs <figs.tex>] [--meta <meta.tex>]

Recognized shapes: \\problem{...} blocks, an enumerate/\\item list, or
examplebox/tryitbox environments (study guides — the ss path binds each box's
prose givens to its positional verify_ss entry). Blocks match verify-JSON
entries by order (block i ↔ i-th JSON id). Heuristic by design — a report for
graders and generators, not a hard gate. Exit 0 always unless files are
unreadable, the parse comes up empty, \\probfig{N} figures cannot be
resolved (pass the figs file scripts/render_figures.py emitted via --figs, or
the figure check runs blind), a problem embeds \\includegraphics (an image
this check can never bind to the JSON — see includegraphics_problems), or the
effort markers fail their binding (below).

Study-guide noise control: worked examples print INTERMEDIATE values by
design (10(0.642788)...), so a flagged prose token with >= 2 decimal places
is auto-matched when it equals a SymPy subexpression of the entry's own
approx expr at the token's printed precision. The >= 2-decimals guard keeps
integer drift (a changed given) from being masked by nearby subexpression
values. Story numbers unused by the computation remain expected flags.

Effort markers (\\probmeta{N} stars / \\probpts{N} point values) are
CONSTRUCTED by scripts/render_meta.py from the verified difficulty tags, so
the only residue to lint is placement — and that residue is hard (exit 2):
  * an unresolved call (no --meta, stale meta, or a tag gap) is an UNCHECKED
    marker, mirroring the \\probfig rule;
  * markers are all-or-nothing and index-bound: if any call appears, problem
    block i must contain exactly its own \\probmeta{i} (or \\probpts{i}),
    one mode for the whole document — swapped, duplicated, missing, or
    mixed-mode calls fail naming the blocks;
  * hand-typed literals (\\bigstar, the unicode star, "(3 pts)") are banned
    unconditionally — markers come from the verified JSON or not at all,
    the same rule hand-drawn valued figures already follow.
