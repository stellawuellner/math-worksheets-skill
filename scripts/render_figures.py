render_figures.py — construct TikZ figures FROM the verify JSON, so a figure
can never disagree with the answer it illustrates.

Why this exists: charts already follow this rule (read_data's "the SAME data
feeds the pgfplots chart") but geometry figures were hand-drawn — the agent
solved the triangle by hand and retyped coordinates into TikZ. The shipped SSA
"swing" reference figure carried wrong hand-computed constants (9.24/3.05 for
the true 9.220/3.037), which is exactly the transcription drift verify.py
exists to kill. This script closes the gap by CONSTRUCTION: the same `given`
dict solve_triangle verifies is what places every vertex, so drawing and check
share one source of truth. Lints stay as belt-and-braces; construction is the
guarantee.

Usage: render_figures.py <verify_TOPIC_DATE.json> [out.tex]
Default output: figs_TOPIC_DATE.tex next to the input (verify_ prefix -> figs_,
matching the ws_/ak_/ss_ naming convention).

What renders:
  * every `type: "triangle"` problem — automatically, from its own `given`
    dict (opt-in marker `"figure": {"kind": "triangle"}` is allowed but adds
    nothing; values inside it are rejected by verify.py so the givens can
    never be duplicated). Ambiguous SSA emits the two-triangle swing figure
    with BOTH computed apexes.
  * problems carrying `"figure": {"kind": "right_triangle", "given":
    {two of a/b/c/A/B}, "solve_for": ..., "unknown": "x"}` — the right angle
    is at C. The renderer draws the figure object regardless of the problem's
    verification type (verify.py gates WHICH types may carry one — approx and
    eval); every figure value must appear as a literal in the problem's
    `expr` or among its `at` values (eval's write-the-ratio shape), which
    binds the drawing to the arithmetic the verifier checked.

Emitted file: one `% >>> probfig N` marker + macro per figured problem and a
single dispatcher `\\probfig{N}`. The worksheet `\\input`s the file and places
`\\probfig{N}` inside problem N's minipage. The markers are what lets
tests/check_prose_consistency.py and tests/check_layout.py splice the figure
bodies back in (--figs) so their figure rules stay sighted.

Figures are to scale: longest drawn side is normalized to ~4.5cm. Labels show
ONLY given values, plus "?" (or the declared unknown name) on solve_for —
never a computed answer. Output is ASCII-only so the pdflatex fallback
compiles it identically to tectonic.

Exit 0: figs file written. Exit 1: invalid input or an impossible figure —
no file is written, because a wrong figure is worse than no figure.

# made a box model useless: it computed clear paper exactly where the page had
# none. These numbers come from \settowidth on the shipped preamble at \small,
