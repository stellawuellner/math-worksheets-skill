# find_python.sh — single source of truth for "which python runs the sympy
# tools". Sourced (not executed) by run_verify.sh and build.sh so every
# entry point resolves the interpreter identically.
#
# WHY not just `command -v python3`: machines routinely carry several pythons
# and the first one found often lacks sympy. The old finder took the first
# EXECUTABLE candidate and then gave up (audit D1b: it chose Homebrew's
# python3, printed "pip3 install sympy", and never tried /usr/bin/python3,
# which had sympy — worse, that pip3 belonged to a third interpreter, so the
# printed fix would not even have fixed it). This finder prefers the first
# candidate that can actually `import sympy`.
#
# MWS_PYTHON_CANDIDATES (space-separated paths) REPLACES the built-in list:
# users pin an interpreter with it, and the test suite uses it to prove both
# directions (a sympy-less python is skipped; no sympy anywhere fails with
# the exact install command for the interpreter that exists).
