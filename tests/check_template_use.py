check_template_use.py — enforce SKILL.md's "\input the shipped template,
never retype it" mechanically.

Usage: python3 tests/check_template_use.py <doc.tex>
                [--template <worksheet-preamble.tex>]

The shipped shell carries \fittedtitle overflow protection, the
workspace-in-minipage \problem semantics, and the exact environment names the
downstream binding gates expect. A hand-rolled preamble drifts in precisely
the places CI (which has no LaTeX engine) cannot see: box styling, headers,
title fitting, workspace glue. Nothing enforced the rule until this gate —
one real session hand-rolled all three document shells and every other gate
stayed green.

Three rules, all on comment-blanked text:

  A. \input{worksheet-preamble} must appear before \begin{document}.
  B. Every \input target must be a shipped template (worksheet-preamble,
     figure-macros) or a rendered figs_/meta_/qa_ file: a local preamble file
     is exactly where hand-rolled redefinitions hide from a doc-only scan.
  C. No definition (\newcommand/\renewcommand/\providecommand/\def,
     \newenvironment/\renewenvironment/\newmdenv/\renewmdenv, \definecolor)
     of an identifier the template ships. The protected set is PARSED from
     templates/worksheet-preamble.tex at run time, never hardcoded — a
     hardcoded list drifts the day the template gains a macro.

Exit 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 usage / missing file.
