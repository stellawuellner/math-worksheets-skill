r"""check_answer_slots.py — every printed response slot needs its own check.

Usage: python3 tests/check_answer_slots.py <ws_*.tex> <verify.json>

WHAT WENT WRONG. SKILL.md promised that "a partially-verified answer key can
never slip through", and verify.py enforced the rule it actually stated: every
problem id 1..N has at least one check. Those are not the same promise. The gate
counts PROBLEMS; the promise is about ANSWERS. A problem printing three blanks
satisfies a per-id gate with one entry, and the other two responses ship
unchecked with nothing anywhere reporting it.

A 300-case review found this in 172 cases — the largest single defect in the
system. Representative: a problem prints "write the number word AND the ones
digit" and verify.json covers only the digit; another prints (a)/(b)/(c) and
verifies (a). In several the unverified part IS the tagged skill, so the sheet's
declared purpose is the thing nobody checked.

WHAT THIS CHECKS. Per problem, the number of printed response slots against the
number of verify entries for that id. Slots are counted from the shipped
preamble's own macro semantics (templates/worksheet-preamble.tex):

  * \ansline, \ansblank and \answerline{...} each print one slot and each
    clears the auto-line flag;
  * \problem[<ws>]{...} with a POSITIVE workspace emits one \ansline itself,
    but only if nothing above cleared the flag — so it adds a slot exactly when
    the segment contains no explicit slot macro and no \noansline;
  * \scratchblank prints the same rule as \ansblank but is NOT an answer slot.
    It exists so a working-space blank (a scaling multiplier, a partial product
    a student carries) can stay on the page without claiming to be an answer.
    Using it is a claim: this blank holds no answer worth checking.

Counting entries, not slots, is deliberate on the JSON side: a `manual` entry is
a check. Declaring the diagnosis half of a find-and-fix item as `manual` is the
correct fix, not a workaround.

Exit 0 clean · 1 on any uncovered slot · 2 when zero problems parse (nothing was
checked — NOT a pass, mirroring the sibling checkers).
