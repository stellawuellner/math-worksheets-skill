r"""render_quick_answers.py — construct the answer key's compact "Quick
Answers" bank FROM the verify JSON, so the at-a-glance grading column can
never disagree with the verified values.

Usage: render_quick_answers.py <verify_<stem>.json> <ak_<stem>.tex> [out.tex]
       [--ws=<ws_<stem>.tex>]
Default output: qa_<stem>.tex next to the JSON (verify_ prefix -> qa_,
mirroring figs_/meta_ naming). build.sh re-runs this EVERY build — the
render-figures pattern — so the gated path cannot go stale and no staleness
lint is needed (a value-comparison checker would just duplicate this
generator).

The bank is one multicols block of "N. value" entries, one per problem id
1..problem_count (verify.py guarantees full id coverage). Entries are PLAIN
TEXT, never \ans/\boxed: check_answer_key.py binds only boxed answers inside
problem segments and never resolves \input, so the bank cannot degrade the
strict per-problem gate (fixture-locked invariant).

Rendering rules (nothing raw is ever injected into LaTeX):
  * numeric expected — verbatim as written in the JSON (Decimal parse keeps
    a verified 6.30 printing as 6.30, not 6.3); a negative number is set in
    math mode so its minus sign is a real minus, not a text hyphen;
  * string expected — validated by verify.py's safe_parse (ONE allowlist for
    the whole system, so a Python builtin like "open" can never reach the
    printer), then re-parsed with evaluate=False and printed in the AUTHOR's
    form: 9/12 stays 9/12, "2 + 3/4" stays a mixed number, and a completely
    factored 3*(x-3)*(x+3) is not silently redistributed;
  * a string that is NOT a mathematical expression under that allowlist
    (a relation "<", a bin label "20-29", "no solution") prints as ITSELF,
    TeX-escaped — never evaluated arithmetically and never hidden;
  * lists comma-joined; an inequality's interval spec prints as an interval,
    a midpoint's pair prints bracketed; dicts as var = value pairs;
  * a VERIFIED empty solution set prints the empty-set symbol, never "---";
  * "---" is RESERVED for "no machine check exists": a manual-only id prints
    it alone, and an id that mixes machine checks with a manual entry prints
    it after the verified values, so a grader can always tell a verified
    answer from an unchecked one;
  * multi-entry ids join all expected values, each labelled by its own
    "slot" (which side, which intercept) when the JSON declares one, so a
    two-slot answer can never read in the wrong order. FOLLOW-UP: "slot" is
    an optional per-entry label this generator reads but verify.py's strict
    schema does not yet accept — add it to _UNIVERSAL_FIELDS there (a label,
    like "note", never touched by any check) before authors can declare it;
    until then a multi-slot id renders as it always did, unlabelled;
  * a declared answer_unit is printed with the value;
  * with --ws, a problem printing MORE responses than the verification covers
    is marked \unchecked, and a "What is verified" note names those problems
    and the manual ones. Without --ws the bank cannot know this and stays
    silent about it — the marks appear only when coverage was actually
    measured, never as decoration.
Column count adapts to the widest rendered entry (4 / 3 / 2) so factored and
interval answers don't wreck the layout.

PREFLIGHT: the ak_ source must \input{worksheet-preamble} (a hand-rolled
preamble is the transcription-drift class that produced the one-answer-per-
paragraph key this tool exists to fix, and the shipped preamble is what
guarantees multicol and the compact \ans) and must \input the bank file —
a generated bank the key never shows is the real silent failure. Both are
hard errors with teaching messages, fixture-tested.

Exit 0: bank written. Exit 1: preflight failure or invalid input.
